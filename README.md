# TSTerm

TSTerm is a software package that provides 3270 terminal functionality in a TypeScript implementation. A brief explanation of the project can be found at:

- https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/292

This code was based from a minified implementation of a terminal included in the OMP Zowe project at:

- https://github.com/zowe/tn3270-ng2

This prior work is licencsed under EPL-2.0 and TSTerm continues to use EPL-2.0. 

This implementation's purpose is to provide a proper Open Source (not minified) means of adding features and fixing bugs in the terminal that Zowe relies upon and for general OSS usage.
