# Code of Conduct

We may adopt a code of conduct (“CoC”) for the Project, which is subject to approval by the Project Manager. In the event that a Project-specific CoC has not been approved, the LF Projects Code of Conduct listed at https://lfprojects.org/policies will apply for all Collaborators in the Project.
